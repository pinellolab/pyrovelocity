# Installation

We currently only support linux amd64 with access to at least one GPU having NVIDIA drivers installed.
This is related to issues [such as this](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/7097) among the indirect dependencies.
We provide a [docker container](https://github.com/pinellolab/pyrovelocity/pkgs/container/pyrovelocity) for the same architecture. We also provide an [IaC development environment](https://github.com/pinellolab/pyrovelocity/blob/master/reproducibility/environment/README.md).

If you are planning to attempt to install Pyro-Velocity on your own linux amd64 machine, it should be performed inside a virtual environment such as provided by [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

## Stable release

To install pyrovelocity from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyrovelocity/) run

$ pip install pyrovelocity
```
