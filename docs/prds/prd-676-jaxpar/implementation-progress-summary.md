# PyroVelocity JAX Implementation Progress Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on the JAX/NumPyro implementation of PyroVelocity as outlined in the PRD-676-JAXPAR project. It tracks completed work, current status, and remaining tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a JAX/NumPyro version of PyroVelocity that achieves feature parity with the modular PyTorch/Pyro implementation while leveraging JAX's functional programming paradigm and optimizations. The implementation follows a phased approach as outlined in the [Implementation Orchestration](08-implementation-orchestration.md) document.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is organized into six phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Architecture** - Function type definitions, registry system, state containers
2. **Phase 2: Component Implementation** - Dynamics, priors, likelihoods, observations, guides
3. **Phase 3: Factory and Configuration** - Configuration classes, factory functions
4. **Phase 4: Inference and Training** - SVI, MCMC, training loop, posterior analysis
5. **Phase 5: Model Comparison and Selection** - Bayesian model comparison, selection criteria
6. **Phase 6: Integration and Examples** - Update example scripts, add docstrings

### Current Status

The implementation has successfully completed all six phases: Phase 1 (Core Architecture), Phase 2 (Component Implementation), Phase 3 (Factory and Configuration), Phase 4 (Inference and Training), Phase 5 (Model Comparison and Selection), and Phase 6 (Integration and Examples). All tests for these phases are passing with good to excellent coverage.

The component tests are flexible and robust, focusing on validating the essential behavior of each component rather than specific implementation details. This approach allows for future refactoring and optimization while maintaining functional correctness.

The factory system provides a flexible and extensible way to create models for the JAX implementation of PyroVelocity. It allows users to:

1. Create models with standard components using `create_standard_model()`
2. Create models with custom configurations using `create_model()`
3. Mix and match different components to create custom models
4. Add new components by registering them in the registry

The inference and training systems work seamlessly with the factory system, allowing users to:

1. Run SVI inference with model configurations or direct model functions
2. Run MCMC inference with model configurations or direct model functions
3. Train models using the training loop with model configurations or direct model functions
4. Extract posterior samples from inference results
5. Analyze posterior samples with the factory system

The model comparison and selection utilities provide powerful tools for model evaluation and selection, allowing users to:

1. Compare models using information criteria (WAIC, LOO)
2. Select the best model based on various criteria
3. Perform cross-validation for model selection
4. Compute predictive performance metrics

The example scripts demonstrate all features of the JAX implementation, providing clear guidance on how to use the new architecture.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **JAX Compatibility**: Ensuring all components work with JAX transformations (jit, vmap, grad) requires careful design and testing.

2. **Type Safety**: Using jaxtyping with beartype for comprehensive type checking adds complexity but improves code quality and catches errors early.

3. **Functional Paradigm**: Maintaining JAX's functional programming paradigm throughout the codebase requires careful attention to state management and side effects.

4. **Legacy Compatibility**: Ensuring at least one model configuration in the registry matches the behavior of the legacy implementation requires careful validation.

## Conclusion

The JAX/NumPyro implementation of PyroVelocity is now complete. We have successfully implemented all six phases of the project: Phase 1 (Core Architecture), Phase 2 (Component Implementation), Phase 3 (Factory and Configuration), Phase 4 (Inference and Training), Phase 5 (Model Comparison and Selection), and Phase 6 (Integration and Examples). All tests for these phases are passing with good to excellent coverage.

Phase 6 completion finalized the implementation by ensuring all components have comprehensive Google-style docstrings and by creating example scripts that demonstrate all features, including model comparison and cross-validation.

The implementation follows JAX's functional programming paradigm and leverages key JAX libraries (diffrax, jaxtyping, NumPyro) to provide a modern, efficient, and extensible implementation of PyroVelocity. The modular architecture with the registry and factory system allows for easy extension and customization, while the comprehensive test suite ensures the implementation is robust and reliable.

This JAX/NumPyro implementation provides a solid foundation for future work, including performance optimization, extended documentation, and additional features. It represents a significant step forward in the evolution of PyroVelocity, providing users with a modern, efficient, and extensible implementation that leverages the power of JAX's functional programming paradigm and optimizations.
