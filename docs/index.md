# Documentation

`pyrovelocity` is a Bayesian, generative, and multivariate RNA velocity
model to estimate *uncertainty* in predictions of future cell states from
minimal models approximating splicing dynamics.
This approach models *raw sequencing counts* with *synchronized cell time* across
all expressed genes to provide quantifiable information on
cell fate choice and developmental trajectory dynamics.

## Features

-   Probabilistic modeling of RNA velocity
-   Direct modeling of raw spliced and unspliced read counts
-   Diagnostic analyses and visualizations of model uncertainty
-   Synchronized cell time estimation across genes
-   Multivariate modeling of gene expression and velocity prediction
