Reproduce Supplementary Figure 3 with model 2
================================================

After installation of [pyrovelocity](https://github.com/pinellolab/pyrovelocity), run the three scripts in order:

1st script is used to generate intermediate model results for pancreas data,

``` bash
python fig2_pancreas_data_model2.py
```

2nd script is used to generate intermediate model results for PBMC data,

``` bash
python fig2_pbmc_data_model2.py
```

Last, run the plot script to assemble the results:

``` bash
python fig2_model2.py
```

For explaination of model 2 and supplementary figure 3, please refer to our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.12.507691v2).
