## Document Overview {#sec-overview}

This document is organized to progressively build understanding of the PyroVelocity project context. It begins with a definition of project scope after which it identifies stakeholders and their concerns. Research goals are articulated to clarify the project's purpose followed by a value proposition justifying the investment. The scientific domain model captures essential workflows and data objects, while the constraints section outlines limitations that must be considered throughout the project. Finally, a glossary ensures consistent terminology usage across all project artifacts.

# Project Scope {#sec-project-scope}

## Problem Description {#sec-problem-description}

Single-cell RNA sequencing, possibly combined with other measurement modalities, provides a snapshot of gene expression in individual cells, but understanding gene-regulatory networks, cellular population dynamics, and developmental trajectories requires temporal information on multiple scales that is not directly captured in these static measurements. The RNA velocity concept proposes to estimate the rate of change of gene expression in an attempt to infer some directional information within gene expression space from these snapshots by leveraging the time delay between unspliced pre-mRNAs and the production of mature spliced mRNA molecules.

Current methods for RNA velocity analysis have several limitations:

1. **Linear deterministic dynamics**: The most widely used methods rely exclusively on deterministic models with analytical solutions that cannot adequately capture the inherent non-linearity and stochasticity in gene expression.

2. **Uncertainty quantification**: These methods lack robust uncertainty quantification, making it difficult to assess the reliability of velocity estimates and downstream analyses.

3. **Parameter estimation**: Current approaches often rely on simplistic parameter estimation techniques that may not fully leverage the information in the data.

4. **Cell fate prediction**: Existing methods provide limited capabilities for predicting and validating cell fate choices and understanding the relationships among gene-regulatory network and developmental trajectory dynamics.

PyroVelocity proposes to address these limitations by developing a probabilistic, generative, and multivariate approach to comparative RNA velocity modeling that supports uncertainty quantification, parameter estimation via multiple inference algorithms, and heuristic or principled model selection.

## Research Objectives {#sec-research-objectives}

PyroVelocity aims to develop a probabilistic framework for RNA velocity analysis that:

1. Models raw spliced and unspliced read counts directly, minimizing information loss from normalization
2. Provides uncertainty quantification for parameter estimates and velocity estimates
3. Synchronizes cell time estimation across genes for coherent trajectory inference
4. Includes support for diagnostic analyses and visualizations related to uncertainty estimation
5. Provides a principled approach to model validation, comparison, and selection
6. Integrates existing ecosystems for single-cell analysis, dynamical simulation, probabilistic modeling, visualization, and type-safe reproducibile workflow orchestration

## Domain Algorithms {#sec-domain-algorithms}

### RNA Velocity Dynamics Model

The core of the PyroVelocity standard likelihood, which serves as a baseline reference for comparison to alternative models, is a mathematical model of RNA transcription and splicing dynamics based on a system of linear ordinary differential equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{du}{dt} &= \alpha - \beta u \\
\frac{ds}{dt} &= \beta u - \gamma s
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $u$ represents unspliced mRNA abundance
- $s$ represents spliced mRNA abundance
- $\alpha$ is the transcription rate
- $\beta$ is the splicing rate
- $\gamma$ is the degradation rate

The analytical solution to this system is:

$$
\begin{align}
u(t) &= u_0 e^{-\beta t} + \frac{\alpha}{\beta}(1 - e^{-\beta t}) \\
s(t) &= s_0 e^{-\gamma t} + \frac{\beta u_0}{\gamma - \beta}(e^{-\beta t} - e^{-\gamma t}) + \frac{\alpha \beta}{\gamma \beta}(1 - \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - \beta}e^{-\beta t} + \frac{\beta}{\gamma - \beta}e^{-\gamma t})
\end{align}
$$

This model is implemented in the `StandardDynamicsModel` component of PyroVelocity.

It is notable that this model lacks the ability to represent interactions among genes.
In order to support more complicated likelihood functions we will need to consider numerical integration of dynamical systems embedded within the forward method of the likelihood model, which generally requires expression in terms of a framework that supports automatic differentiation in order to produce gradients for inference.

### Inference Algorithms

#### Variational Inference

PyroVelocity uses Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) for parameter estimation:

1. Define a joint probability model $p(x, z)$ where $x$ are observed data and $z$ are latent variables
2. Approximate the posterior $p(z|x)$ with a variational distribution $q(z)$
3. Minimize the KL divergence between $q(z)$ and $p(z|x)$ by maximizing the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound)
4. Use stochastic gradient descent for optimization

This is implemented using Pyro's SVI framework in the inference components of PyroVelocity.
