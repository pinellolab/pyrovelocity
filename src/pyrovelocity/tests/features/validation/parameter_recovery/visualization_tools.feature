Feature: Visualization Tools for Recovery Validation
  As a researcher using PyroVelocity
  I want to visualize parameter recovery performance
  So that I can intuitively understand the strengths and limitations of my model

  Background:
    Given I have a VisualizationTools component
    And I have true parameter values
    And I have posterior samples from inference
    And I have evaluation metrics

  Scenario: Create parameter recovery plots
    Given posterior samples for parameters alpha, beta, and gamma
    When I create parameter recovery plots
    Then I should get scatter plots of true vs. estimated parameters
    And the plots should include uncertainty bars
    And the plots should include a diagonal line for perfect recovery
    And the plots should be labeled with appropriate titles and axes

  Scenario: Create posterior distribution plots
    Given posterior samples for parameters alpha, beta, and gamma
    When I create posterior distribution plots
    Then I should get density plots of posterior distributions
    And the plots should mark the true parameter values
    And the plots should include credible intervals
    And the plots should be labeled with appropriate titles and axes

  Scenario: Create coverage plots
    Given credible intervals for parameters alpha, beta, and gamma
    When I create coverage plots
    Then I should get visual representations of credible interval coverage
    And the plots should indicate which parameters fall within their credible intervals
    And the plots should be labeled with appropriate titles and axes

  Scenario: Create error distribution plots
    Given recovery errors for parameters alpha, beta, and gamma
    When I create error distribution plots
    Then I should get histograms or density plots of recovery errors
    And the plots should mark zero error
    And the plots should be labeled with appropriate titles and axes

  Scenario: Create sample size effect plots
    Given evaluation metrics for different sample sizes
    When I create sample size effect plots
    Then I should get line plots showing how metrics change with sample size
    And the plots should be labeled with appropriate titles and axes

  Scenario: Create inference method comparison plots
    Given evaluation metrics for different inference methods
    When I create inference method comparison plots
    Then I should get bar charts comparing methods
    And the plots should be labeled with appropriate titles and axes

  Scenario: Create summary dashboard
    Given all evaluation metrics and visualizations
    When I create a summary dashboard
    Then I should get a comprehensive visual summary of parameter recovery
    And the dashboard should include key plots and metrics
    And the dashboard should be organized in a logical and intuitive way

  Scenario: Save visualizations to files
    Given I have created various visualization plots
    When I save the visualizations to files
    Then the files should be created in the specified format
    And the files should be properly named
